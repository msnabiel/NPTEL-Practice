After an X-ray of her feet the doctors were stunned to see that what she thought was bad bruising to her ankles actually turned out to be two fractures. The doctors advised her not to compete as she was not fit enough for a high-performance sport like skiing. But, she went on to consult a psychologist and following her advice, Camplin competed and made her way to the top of the podium as the Olympic champion. In fact, during her career Camplin dealt with two broken ankles, two knee reconstructions, nine cracked ribs, and a number of concussions, and finally lost her first child to congenital heart disease.

During their reunion they were discussing their work experience under their bosses. Deepak works at a private bank. He told his friends that his manager is laser-focused on the performance of his employees, and establishes predetermined incentives usually in the form of monetary reward for success and disciplinary action for failure. He meets each member of the team bi-weekly to discuss ways the team can meet and exceed monthly company goals to get their bonus. Each of the top 10 performers in the district receives a monetary reward. On the other hand, Nandini, a graphic designer, shared that she is not very happy with her current work environment. Her boss is focused almost entirely on results and efficiency. He often makes decisions alone or with a small, trusted group and expects employees to do exactly what they’re asked to do, more like a military commander. Nandini feels that this kind of rigid environment can prove to be helpful for some undisciplined colleagues, whereas the rest of them are struggling with their creative tasks. Deepak’s case is an example of ________, whereas the leadership style of Nandini’s boss can be best described as ____________. (Fill in the blanks)",
